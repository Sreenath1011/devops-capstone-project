**As a** customer service representative  
**I need** to manage customer accounts by reading, updating, and deleting account information  
**So that** I can maintain accurate records of customer names and addresses for effective service delivery  

### Details and Assumptions
* The accounts service will interface with a database that stores customer names and addresses.
* Users will have different access levels; only authorized personnel can update or delete account information.
* The system should handle errors gracefully, providing feedback when actions cannot be completed.

### Acceptance Criteria     
Given I have access to the account management interface  
When I select a customer account to view  
Then I should see the customer's name and address details displayed.  

Given I am viewing a customer account  
When I update the customer's name or address and submit the changes  
Then the updated information should be saved in the database and reflected in the account details.  

Given I am viewing a customer account  
When I choose to delete the account  
Then the account should be removed from the database, and I should receive a confirmation message.
